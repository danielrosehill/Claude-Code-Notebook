This repository contains my own reference notes for using Claude Code CLI.

I'll ask you to help out with:

- Reformatting loose notes in to more well-developed notes
- Fixing typos in my notes 
- Organising this notebook 
- Improving my drafts for clarity and flow 
- Checking for accuracy 

## Conventions

Claude Code CLI is a moving entity so it's very important that we note the date at the top of every note.

## References

I'll synthesise a few sources of information here: my own trial and error; Anthropic's docs; and Reddit threads (!). Reddit is actually very useful as there are active communities that discuss things that aren't so clear from the docs themselves. 

When jotting down my "rough notes" I'll often write incomplete markdown (I won't typically write out anchor links). Watch out for those and reformat my links.
