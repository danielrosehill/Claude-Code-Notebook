# Other Notebooks (Related)

My prolific rate of Github repo creation this month has a little to do with caffeine and more to do with a longstanding habit of "atomic" thinking: I try to work on projects in small modular chunks and then synthesise later.

Thus those notebooks which I do share publicly tend to be very specific gatherings of notes that I eventually either subsume into more general ones via submodules or ... you know ... copy and paste.

Because MCP is both frustratingly complicating and has uses across AI tools, I created this for capturing thosef successfull code snippets:
