# Great Resources

The Claude Code community is gathering at pace. 

These are some super helpful websites and resources that I will rely upon frequently.

Did you ever stumble upon someone online and even though you've never met them you have a very strong feeling you would get along?

Thus I feel about Inventor Black - a Redditor who moderates Claude AI,  publishes Claude Log, and who has also invented a fascinating UI interface called the Command Stick:

## Subreddits

Claude Code's surge in popularity was kind of accidental. 

The biggest Claude/Anthropic sub remains /r/ClaudeAI (at the time I'm writing this 358K subs):

https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/

But there *is* a /r/ClaudeCode (as above, 40K subs)

https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/

I was also highly excited to see /r/claudeexplorers "home to explore all non-coding Claude AI interactions, among cozy and open-minded people."

https://www.reddit.com/r/claudexplorers/

I am a huge believer in the idea that code development just scratches the surface of what agentic AI CLIs can do and that, in addition to research, there are almost limitless use-cases (I may have written this before)
