## About

This repository contains personal reference notes for using Claude Code CLI, synthesized from hands-on experience, Anthropic's official documentation, and community discussions (particularly Reddit threads where users share insights not always apparent in official docs).

The notes here cover configuration, workflows, integrations (like MCP servers), and practical tips for getting the most out of Claude Code CLI. As Claude Code CLI is actively evolving, all notes include dates to track when information was current.
